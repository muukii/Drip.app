## Overview

This app has very focused on only one function that applies LUT filter.  
The motivation comes from basically I'm using Lightroom Classic to edit photos and using presets.

When I take a picture on mobile and do not need so much editing just applying preset is fine, Lightroom Mobile helps us but it's a bit too much for me.  

This app has Photos extension to enable editing on Photos app with nondestructive.
